This is a downsampled subset of the painting images contained in the
CC0 torrent of all Rijksmuseum images at [academic torrents](https://academictorrents.com/details/db3cd9defd6d3f16f0a0e6cd0ada882792b9f782)

The JSON file can be loaded directly into pandas with `pd.read_json(...)`.  It is a join of the metadata from the torrent and exiftool metadatadata before the downsampling to fit in an 800x800 box.
